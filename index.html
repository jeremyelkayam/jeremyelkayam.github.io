			Hi! I'm Jeremy, a DevOps Engineer at CGI Federal, currently based out of Arlington, VA. 
			I've been programming ever since I discovered LEGO Mindstorms and Scratch at age 10, but my 
			computer science began when I was 15. In high school, I initially struggled to adjust, but when 
			I decided to take an intro computer science class in my sophomore year, I suddenly felt in my 
			element for the first time. I was in CS classes every semester from then until I graduated college
			in 2020, <a href="http://www.wm.edu/" target="_blank">William & Mary</a>.
			<br><br>
			I do a lot of DevOps for my day job, but my passion is in software. I've made loads of games and 
			other projects on the side!

							A port of the 2003 Flash game TROGDOR! to the Game Boy Advance. 
							In this game, you control the mighty dragon TROGDOR the BURNiNATOR, and squish the 
							peasants of the land in order to achieve BURNINATION. With your fire-breathing powers, 
							you can destroy the thatched-roof cottages and complete the game's 100 levels. 
							But be careful! Archers and knights are sworn to protect the countryside and will kill Trogdor if given a chance.
							<br><br>
							My port of the game contains everything from the original Flash game, recreated in C++ using Butano (a homebrew GBA game engine).
							I also added some new features including:
							<ul>
								<li>saving your progress</li>
								<li>a tutorial</li>
								<li>the TROGHAMMER, a new, more powerful enemy inspired by <a href="https://trogdorboardgame.homestarrunner.com/">the board game version of Trogdor</a>. </li>
								<li>adjustable options such as volume and difficulty parameters</li>

							In late 2020, I was really bored and decided to remake Warriors, a game that my younger brother and I had created in Scratch when we were in our young teens. We had originally made the game in Scratch and styled it after an Atari 2600 game. I made this remake in SFML because I'd used it for my game dev class two years earlier. 
							<br><br>
							This is a game where you move around a field and kill baddies as more and more come at you. Occasionally, health potions appear on the field. Once per game, a bomb will appear that kills all enemies on screen, and a ring will appear that drains the life of enemies you kill and restores it to you. As you play, more enemy warriors appear and fewer health potions appear. I also coded my own key bindings, which was kinda tough but I was proud of it. 
							<br><br>
							Since I'd already done it in the Atari style, I decided to model my version after the machine they played games on across the pond in the late 70s/early 80s, the ZX Spectrum. I'm particularly proud of how I mimicked the Spectrum's color-clash effect. I also added support for up to 8 players (our original Scratch version only had 4).						</p><br>

							Winter 2018
						</h5>
						<p>
							This was my final project for Intro to Game Design and Game Development, which I took at William & Mary in fall 2018. 
							We made a functional, junk food-themed tower defense game as 4 students whose only C++ experience was remaking Pong. And we did it in only 2 1/2 months! 
							I wish we'd gotten to polish it up a lot more, but I'm proud of what we made. We programmed the whole thing soup-to-nuts and did our own art as well.
							<br><br>
							This game has 4 different types of towers, 3 types of enemies, and 3 tiers of upgrades for each tower (e.g. cola -> energy drink),
							with the option of upgrading between 2 separate types of tower for the final level (e.g. energy drink -> slushie OR gravy).
							Additionally, you can upgrade a tower's individual stats (e.g. range, rate of fire, etc). The maps and waves of enemies are 
							also procedurally generated based on parameters the user provides. 
							<br><br>
							We were really ambitious with this game, and even though we didn't get it as polished as we'd originally intended, 
							we worked really hard to get a basic version of all of our ideas in there, which I'm happy with. 
							This was also my first time making my own art for a game (I did the art for all of the towers and enemies). 
							It's pretty rough but I think I made it decently expressive.

						<p>
							This was the final project for my Entrepreneurship in Computer Science class, which I took in the spring of my junior year at W&M. I worked on coding this with 3 other students.
							<br><br>
							Have you ever experienced the tedium of taking attendance at the beginning of a class or other event? 
							How about having to sit around for the first 5-10 minutes as the instructor goes through the entire class roster?
							We created Entella to solve this problem.
							<br><br>
							Entella uses facial recognition to check the attendance of an entire room of people with a single photograph.
							As a host/instructor, you can check attendance records for your entire class, and as a student you can check
							the records to make sure your attendance is recorded properly.
