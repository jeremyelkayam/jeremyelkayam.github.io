      <description>Go To The Toilet is an animated music video for the song Go To The Toilet by Dave Bulmer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t make the song, but everything you see in the video was drawn and animated by me. I worked on this video during my free time at university from April 2019 to March 2020. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at school over the summer of 2019 (mid-May to mid-August), so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t working on it then.</description>
