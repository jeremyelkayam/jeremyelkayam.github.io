      <description>Hi, it&amp;rsquo;s me, Jeremy Elkayam. I made a website because I figured it was time I had one. It has a blog, because I wanted it to have a blog. I like to write about things that I do, so I&amp;rsquo;m going to do that on this blog.
Where I Started Because I like to do things out of order, the first thing I did was register a domain name. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to do that first.</description>
