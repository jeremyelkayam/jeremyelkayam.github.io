      <description>Go To The Toilet is an animated music video for the song Go To The Toilet by Dave Bulmer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t make the song, but everything you see in the video was drawn and animated by me. I worked on this video during my free time at university from April 2019 to March 2020. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at school over the summer of 2019 (mid-May to mid-August), so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t working on it then.</description>

      <description>Food Fight was a 2D tower-defense video game created for the class Intro to Video Game Design and Development at William &amp;amp; Mary. The game features a 4 different tower types with branching upgrades for a total of 16 towers, 3 different types of enemies with procedural variation in stats, a money system, and procedurally generated maps. All of the game&amp;rsquo;s artwork was created by me. I also did a lot of programming work on the project, creating all of the enemy unit systems, and helping to debug the map creation engine.</description>
