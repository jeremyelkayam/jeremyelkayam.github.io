      <description>Go To The Toilet is an animated music video for the song Go To The Toilet by Dave Bulmer. I didn&amp;rsquo;t make the song, but everything you see in the video was drawn and animated by me. I worked on this video during my free time at university from April 2019 to March 2020. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t at school over the summer of 2019 (mid-May to mid-August), so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t working on it then.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve had a very busy past few days. Everything about my weekend has had to do with the sketch comedy group that I&amp;rsquo;m a part of here at college, called 7th Grade Sketch Comedy. Sometime soon I&amp;rsquo;ll do a deeper dive into why exactly I&amp;rsquo;ve put so much of myself into sketch comedy over the past 3 1/2 years of school, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s important to know that I collaborate on sketch shows with these people and we also make videos together.</description>
