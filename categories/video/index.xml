      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve had a very busy past few days. Everything about my weekend has had to do with the sketch comedy group that I&amp;rsquo;m a part of here at college, called 7th Grade Sketch Comedy. Sometime soon I&amp;rsquo;ll do a deeper dive into why exactly I&amp;rsquo;ve put so much of myself into sketch comedy over the past 3 1/2 years of school, but for now it&amp;rsquo;s important to know that I collaborate on sketch shows with these people and we also make videos together.</description>
