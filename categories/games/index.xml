      <description>Just like most people who can afford video games, I’ve spent the last few months playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons, the latest entry in Nintendo’s long-running Animal Crossing franchise. I’ve been playing Animal Crossing since I was eight years old, but I’ve been playing this one a bit differently from how I’ve played in the past.

      <description>Food Fight was a 2D tower-defense video game created for the class Intro to Video Game Design and Development at William &amp;amp; Mary. The game features a 4 different tower types with branching upgrades for a total of 16 towers, 3 different types of enemies with procedural variation in stats, a money system, and procedurally generated maps. All of the game&amp;rsquo;s artwork was created by me. I also did a lot of programming work on the project, creating all of the enemy unit systems, and helping to debug the map creation engine.</description>
